# Logging Best Practices

This guide defines logging conventions for Symphony so Codex can diagnose failures quickly.

## Goals

- Make logs searchable by issue and session.
- Capture enough execution context to identify root cause without reruns.
- Keep messages stable so dashboards/alerts are reliable.

## Required Context Fields

When logging issue-related work, include both identifiers:

- `issue_id`: Linear internal UUID (stable foreign key).
- `issue_identifier`: human ticket key (for example `MT-620`).

When logging Codex execution lifecycle events, include:

- `session_id`: combined Codex thread/turn identifier.

## Focused Log Searches

Use the existing context fields to inspect only the relevant lines for an issue or session:

```bash
rg -F 'issue_identifier=DEV-318 ' <LOG_DIR_OR_ROTATED_LOG_GLOB>
rg -F 'session_id=<SESSION_ID> ' <LOG_DIR_OR_ROTATED_LOG_GLOB>
```

Choose a local log directory or glob that includes every rotated segment, and
keep it as an explicit placeholder in notes. Include the delimiter after the
field value in the fixed string so ticket prefixes do not match other issues.
Share only the smallest matching lines needed for the investigation, and never
paste full logs, secrets, or credentials.

## Message Design

- Use explicit `key=value` pairs in message text for high-signal fields.
- Prefer deterministic wording for recurring lifecycle events.
- Include the action outcome (`completed`, `failed`, `retrying`) and the reason/error when available.
- Avoid logging large payloads unless required for debugging.

## Scope Guidance

- `AgentRunner`: log start/completion/failure with issue context, plus `session_id` when known.
- `Orchestrator`: log dispatch, retry, terminal/non-active transitions, and worker exits with issue context. Include `session_id` whenever running-entry data has it.
- `Codex.AppServer`: log session start/completion/error with issue context and `session_id`.

## Checklist For New Logs

- Is this event tied to a Linear issue? Include `issue_id` and `issue_identifier`.
- Is this event tied to a Codex session? Include `session_id`.
- Is the failure reason present and concise?
- Is the message format consistent with existing lifecycle logs?
